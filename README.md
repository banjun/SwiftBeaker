## Examples

see [Examples](./Examples)

## Real World Examples

[banjun/imastodon Mastodon API](https://github.com/banjun/imastodon/blob/m%40ster/API/Mastodon.swift)

release ([SwiftBeaker/releases](https://github.com/banjun/SwiftBeaker/releases))

```sh
% swift build -c release -Xswiftc -static-stdlib
```

## Usage

```sh
% drafter -f json api-blueprint-document.md > apib.json # generate AST using drafter
% SwiftBeaker apib.json > APIClient.swift
```

for use in a framework target for the API:

```sh
% SwiftBeaker --public apib.json > APIClient.swift # public memberwise init & public members
```

## Conversion

SwiftBeaker converts ...

* each Transitions into a [APIKit](https://github.com/ishkawa/APIKit)`.Request`
* each Responses bound to a Request into a `enum Responses` whose cases identified by a pair of status code and content type
* each Data Structures (named and anonymous) into a [Himotoki](https://github.com/ikesyo/Himotoki)`.Decodable` struct
